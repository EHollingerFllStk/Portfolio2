            <h2>Elizabeth (Beth) Hollinger, Full Stack Engineer</h2>
            <p> A physical therapist gone rogue to explore the digital world of code! I am a Full Stack Software Engineer who champions diversity, equity and inclusion üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà. I became interested in coding during the pandemic. I realized that I enjoyed the challenges of developing and designing mobile and web applications. Since my Software Engineering Immersive, I am even more excited to apply what I have learned into practice diving into projects, volunteer work and Hackathons. In my spare time you'll find me plucking away on my ukulele and getting lost in the forest! </p>
